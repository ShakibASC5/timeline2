    The creators of Holow Knight
</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Pellen</strong> and <Strong> Gibson</Strong> the creators of hollow knight met 16 years ago throught mutual friends, but didn’t start working together until shortly before Hollow Knight’s development, when they began entering game jams together. Countless indie teams have been forged in the feverish days of creativity a jam entails – Team Cherry is no different.For the 27th iteration, held in August 2013, a nascent Team Cherry created a top-down survival title called Hungry Knight, in which the now-familiar hero kills bugs to stave off starvation.
